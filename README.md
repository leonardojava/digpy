# Hand Written Digit Classifier
Basic neural network that classifies images of hand drawn digits using just Python with NumPy
When I tested I got around 84-87% accuracy
I got more indepth on the kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/leonardovo/digits)
# Dataset I used:
AstroDave and Will Cukierski. Digit Recognizer. https://kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer, 2012. Kaggle.
